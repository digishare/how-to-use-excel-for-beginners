Excel is an incredibly powerful tool for getting meaning out of vast amounts of data. But it also works really well for simple calculations and tracking almost any kind of information. The key for unlocking all that potential is the grid of cells. Cells can contain numbers, text, or formulas. You put data in your cells and group them in rows and columns. That allows you to add up your data, sort and filter it, put it in tables, and build great-looking charts. Let’s go through the basic steps to get you started.



## Create a new workbook
Excel documents are called workbooks. Each workbook has sheets, typically called spreadsheets. You can add as many sheets as you want to a workbook, or you can create new workbooks to keep your data separate.

1. Click File, and then click New.

2. Under New, click the Blank workbook.





## Enter your data

1. Click an empty cell.

	For example, cell A1 on a new sheet. Cells are referenced by their location in the row and column on the sheet, so cell A1 is in the first row of column A.

2. Type text or a number in the cell.

3. Press Enter or Tab to move to the next cell.



## Apply cell borders

1. Select the cell or range of cells that you want to add a border to.

2. On the Home tab, in the Font group, click the arrow next to Borders, and then click the border style that you want.



## Save your work

1. **Click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar, or press Ctrl+S.**


	a. If you’ve saved your work before, you’re done.

2. **If this is the first time you've save this file:** 

	a. Under Save As, pick where to save your workbook, and then browse to a folder.

	b. In the File name box, enter a name for your workbook.

	c. Click Save.
